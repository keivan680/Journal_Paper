Subject: Re: Theorem 4.19 and Paper Revision Assessment

Dear Nicola,

Thank you for suggesting Theorem 4.19 from Haddad's book. After careful examination, I don't recommend using the semistability route. Theorem 4.19 requires the system to be Lyapunov stable (meaning every equilibrium is stable), which would require additional proof work that isn't currently in our manuscript. Our current approach using the Singleton Lemma is more direct and self-contained—it proves point convergence using only the ISL property at equilibria, which we already have from our Lyapunov function. The custom lemma is actually simpler and more transparent for our specific setting.

Regarding the overall assessment: I've completed the detailed analysis (AI_Assessment_Report.pdf attached). The revision quality is strong (8/10) with the Main Contributions section excellently addressing Reviewer 4's primary concern and the proof structure providing appropriate mathematical rigor. The manuscript is ready for resubmission—the only optional enhancements identified are minor polish items like adding 1-2 explicit comparisons to prior work in some responses.

Best regards,
Keivan
