# LaTeX Document Fixes Summary

## Problem Identified
The `Main_Revised.pdf` was showing distorted fonts, table alignment issues, and other formatting problems when compiled from `Main_Revised.tex`.

## Root Cause
The extensive use of `{\color{blue}` commands throughout the document (75+ instances) was causing compatibility issues with the IEEE journal class (`ieeecolor.cls`). The color package was not properly handling the blue color definition in this specific document class context.

## Solutions Provided

### Solution 1: Main_Revised_Fixed.tex
This version replaces problematic color commands with a properly defined revision marking system:
- Changed `\usepackage{color}` to `\usepackage{xcolor}` for better compatibility
- Added proper color definition: `\definecolor{revisionblue}{rgb}{0,0,0.8}`
- Created a custom command `\rev{}` for marking revisions
- Replaced all `{\color{blue}` instances with `\rev{`

**To compile:** `pdflatex Main_Revised_Fixed.tex`

### Solution 2: Main_Revised_Clean.tex
This version completely removes all color formatting:
- Removed all `{\color{blue}` commands while preserving the content
- Cleaned up any remaining color commands in appendices
- Results in a clean document without color marking but with all content intact

**To compile:** `pdflatex Main_Revised_Clean.tex`

## Files Created
1. **Main_Revised_Fixed.tex** - Version with proper color handling using xcolor package
2. **Main_Revised_Clean.tex** - Version with all color commands removed
3. **Main_Revised_backup.tex** - Backup of original file
4. **fix_colors.py** - Python script used to fix color issues
5. **remove_colors.py** - Python script used to remove all colors

## Compilation Instructions
Both fixed versions should compile correctly with standard LaTeX commands:
```bash
pdflatex Main_Revised_Fixed.tex
bibtex Main_Revised_Fixed
pdflatex Main_Revised_Fixed.tex
pdflatex Main_Revised_Fixed.tex
```

Or for the clean version:
```bash
pdflatex Main_Revised_Clean.tex
bibtex Main_Revised_Clean
pdflatex Main_Revised_Clean.tex
pdflatex Main_Revised_Clean.tex
```

## Recommendation
- Use **Main_Revised_Fixed.tex** if you want to maintain the blue revision markings for review purposes
- Use **Main_Revised_Clean.tex** for the final submission without revision markings

Both versions should compile without the font distortion and table alignment issues present in the original `Main_Revised.tex`.
