This manuscript proposes a dynamical system-based approach for solving
robust optimization problems in a general convex-concave framework.
This proposed approach offers a novel solution to robust optimization
problems by introducing a continuous-time dynamical system.
Additionally, the proposed dynamical system-based approach offers
better properties compared to traditional approaches and demonstrates
the potential to solve a broad range of robust optimization problems in
a decentralized manner. Some detailed comments are given as follows.
The improvements compared to the existing results are also unclear,
which makes it difficult to evaluate the contribution of this article.
There are some language and grammar issues in this paper and the
authors need to revise their paper properly.
The definite article in the captions of all figures is suggested to be
omitted. In general, the definite article in the title should be
omitted.
 The italics of many formulas in this manuscript are not standard, and
there are some inconsistent phenomena.
There are issues with the quotation marks in the manuscript.
