The reviewer acknowledges the authors’ efforts in addressing a relevant
and timely problem. The core idea presented is original and points
toward a promising research direction with potential impact. However,
the current manuscript has several important limitations in terms of
technical depth and presentation, which make it unsuitable for
publication as a full research article.
Given the value of the contribution, the reviewer encourages the
authors to consider re-submitting the work in the form of a technical
note. This would allow the main idea to be shared with the community
while leaving room for future refinement and development. The reviewer
has provided specific comments in the attached file and hopes they will
help improve the quality of the current submission.
