\section{Executive Summary}

This report provides an independent assessment of the author responses to reviewer comments for the manuscript "Robust Optimization via Continuous-Time Dynamics". The analysis identifies gaps, weak responses, and areas requiring strengthening before resubmission.

\subsection{Key Findings}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{success}{Strong areas}: Abstract improvements, structural reorganization, abbreviation definitions
\item \textcolor{warning}{Moderate concerns}: Some responses feel boilerplate, technical depth varies
\item \textcolor{critical}{Critical gaps}: Reviewer 10's Theorem 4 criticism requires direct technical engagement
\end{itemize}

\section{Detailed Assessment by Reviewer}

\subsection{Reviewer 4 Analysis}

\textbf{Comment 1: Unclear improvements over existing results}

\textbf{Response Quality:} \textcolor{warning}{Moderate - 6/10}

\textbf{Assessment:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{What works:} Lists six numbered contributions clearly
\item \textbf{Gap:} Doesn't explicitly compare to existing methods (e.g., how does contribution 3 improve over \cite{bental2009}?)
\item \textbf{Missing:} No quantitative comparison table showing "before/after" or "us vs. them"
\item \textbf{Reviewer likely wants:} Explicit statement like "Unlike \cite{X}, our approach achieves Y without requiring Z"
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendation:} Add 2-3 sentences explicitly contrasting each contribution with prior work by name.

\textbf{Comment 2: Language and grammar issues}

\textbf{Response Quality:} \textcolor{success}{Good - 8/10}

\textbf{Assessment:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{What works:} Concrete examples of fixes (figure captions)
\item \textbf{What works:} Quantitative claim ("30+ sentences split")
\item \textbf{Minor gap:} Doesn't mention fixing quotation marks or formula italics explicitly
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendation:} Add one sentence: "Fixed quotation marks throughout and standardized formula italics per IEEE style."

\subsection{Reviewer 5 Analysis}

\textbf{Comment 1: Introduction structure and contributions}

\textbf{Response Quality:} \textcolor{success}{Good - 8/10}

\textbf{Assessment:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{What works:} Lists all new subsection headings
\item \textbf{What works:} Shows opening paragraph
\item \textbf{Strength:} Demonstrates systematic reorganization
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendation:} Solid response. No changes needed.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{Comment 2-5: Technical clarifications}

\textbf{Response Quality:} \textcolor{warning}{Adequate - 7/10}

\textbf{Assessment:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Most responses quote the added blue text
\item Some feel formulaic: "We added clarification..."
\item \textbf{Gap:} Doesn't always explain \textit{why} the addition addresses the concern
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendation:} For each technical comment, add: "This addresses your concern by [specific reason]"

\subsection{Reviewer 6 Analysis}

\textbf{Comment 1-6: Multiple technical points}

\textbf{Response Quality:} \textcolor{warning}{Variable - 5-8/10}

\textbf{Assessment by comment:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Lagrangian necessity (Comment 1):}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Response quotes blue text but doesn't directly answer "why lengthy derivation?"
   \item \textcolor{warning}{Gap:} Needs explicit: "The derivation is necessary because [specific reason]"
   \item Score: 6/10
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Problem formulation motivation (Comment 2):}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Response explains role of $c_i$ terms well
   \item Good technical depth
   \item Score: 8/10
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Max operation non-smoothness (Comment 3):}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Response: "Our dynamics handle non-smoothness naturally..."
   \item \textcolor{warning}{Feels boilerplate} - lacks specific technical mechanism
   \item \textbf{Needed:} "Projection operators in Eq. (X) handle discontinuities via..."
   \item Score: 5/10
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Lemma 1 novelty (Comment 4):}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Good response explaining violation of joint concavity
   \item Strong technical engagement
   \item Score: 9/10
   \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reviewer 10 Analysis}

\textbf{Overall Assessment:} \textcolor{critical}{Critical gaps - 4/10}

\textbf{Major Concern - Theorem 4 Proof:}

\textbf{Reviewer's exact criticism:} "From the reviewer's perspective, the conclusion presented in the final paragraph of the proof of Theorem 4 is neither straightforward nor self-evident. To improve clarity and support the argument, further elaboration and justification are recommended."

\textbf{Source:} \texttt{AttachmentToReview359605(Reviewer10).md}, line 1304

\textbf{Current response:} Completely restructured entire proof with 6 labeled steps

\textbf{\textcolor{critical}{Critical Problem:}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Reviewer criticized only the \textit{final paragraph}
\item Current revision restructures \textit{entire proof} with 6 steps (doubled length)
\item \textbf{This looks like wholesale AI rewrite - major red flag for reviewers}
\item Original proof was ~30 lines, simple structure; new version is ~60 lines
\item Massive overreaction to targeted criticism
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendation:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Revert to original proof structure}
\item Add \textit{only} the specific paragraph addressing reviewer's concern
\item Consider citing established result (e.g., Theorem 4.19 from reference book if applicable)
\item Mark additions minimally in blue
\item Response should say: "We clarified the final argument by [specific addition] and added citation to [established result]"
\end{enumerate}

\section{Cross-Cutting Issues}

\subsection{Boilerplate Language Patterns}

Several responses follow this template:
\begin{quote}
"We added clarification [quote blue text]"
\end{quote}

\textbf{Problem:} Doesn't demonstrate \textit{engagement} with reviewer's concern

\textbf{Better pattern:}
\begin{quote}
"You raised concern about [X]. We address this by [specific change] because [reason]. See [location]."
\end{quote}

\subsection{Missing Quantitative Support}

\begin{itemize}
\item Several claims lack numbers: "significant improvement", "better performance"
\item \textbf{Strengthen:} Where possible, add specific metrics from simulations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Depth Variation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Some responses deeply technical (Lemma 1 - excellent)
\item Others surface-level (non-smoothness handling - weak)
\item \textbf{Goal:} Uniform technical rigor across all responses
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific Action Items}

\subsection{High Priority (Must Fix)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textcolor{critical}{\textbf{Theorem 4 proof:}} Revert to minimal changes, avoid appearance of AI rewrite
\item \textcolor{critical}{\textbf{Reviewer 6 Comment 3:}} Add specific technical detail on non-smoothness handling
\item \textcolor{warning}{\textbf{Reviewer 4 Comment 1:}} Add explicit comparisons to prior work
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Medium Priority (Should Fix)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add "why this addresses your concern" to 5-6 boilerplate responses
\item Verify quotation marks and formula italics fixes are mentioned
\item Check all blue-marked text is actually visible in manuscript
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Low Priority (Nice to Have)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add page/line numbers to responses for easy reviewer verification
\item Consider brief summary table: "Comment $\rightarrow$ Change $\rightarrow$ Location"
\end{enumerate}

\section{Theorem 4.19 Verification}

\textbf{Question:} Does Theorem 4.19 from the referenced book apply to our setting?

\textbf{Assessment needed:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires seeing the actual theorem statement
\item Must verify: (1) Set-valued map assumptions, (2) Lyapunov conditions, (3) Conclusion matches our claim
\item \textbf{If applicable:} Citing established result is much safer than new proof
\item \textbf{If not applicable:} Must keep original proof with minimal clarification
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recommendation:} Please provide Theorem 4.19 statement for verification.

\section{Overall Assessment}

\textbf{Responsiveness Score:} 6.5/10

\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Structural improvements are well-documented
\item Many responses include concrete examples
\item Blue marking system makes changes trackable
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Weaknesses:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Some responses don't engage deeply with reviewer concerns
\item Boilerplate language in several places
\item Theorem 4 revision risks appearing as AI-generated
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Resubmission Readiness:} \textcolor{warning}{Not yet ready - address high-priority items first}

\section{Recommendations Summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Immediately:} Revert Theorem 4 proof to original + minimal clarification
\item \textbf{Before resubmission:} Add explicit comparisons to prior work (Reviewer 4)
\item \textbf{Before resubmission:} Strengthen technical depth in 3-4 weak responses
\item \textbf{Consider:} Verify Theorem 4.19 applicability and cite if valid
\item \textbf{Polish:} Review all responses for boilerplate language
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{1cm}

\noindent\textit{This assessment aims to strengthen the resubmission by identifying gaps the reviewers will notice. The goal is a thorough, professional response that directly addresses each concern without appearing AI-generated or evasive.}
