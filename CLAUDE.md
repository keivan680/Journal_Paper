# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview
This is a journal paper submission titled "Robust Optimization via Continuous-Time Dynamics" that uses IEEE journal format. The paper proposes a dynamical system-based approach for solving robust optimization problems and is currently under review.

## Build Commands
To compile the LaTeX document:
```bash
# Preferred method - use the automated script:
./create_pdf.sh Main_Cleaned_Revised.tex

# Manual compilation sequence:
pdflatex Main.tex    # First pass - creates .aux file
bibtex Main          # Process bibliography - creates .bbl file  
pdflatex Main.tex    # Second pass - integrate citations
pdflatex Main.tex    # Third pass - resolve all references
```

## PDF Building Lessons (IMPORTANT)

### Critical Requirements
1. **Bibliography file MUST be in working directory**: Copy `2.References.bib` from archive if missing
2. **Run full compilation sequence**: First pass → bibtex → second pass → third pass
3. **Remove problematic citations**: Delete any 2024 preprint citations (maxminmax2024, drago2024, etc.)

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **All citations showing as [?]**: Missing .bib file - copy from archive/
- **Undefined references persist**: Run `bibtex` between first and second pdflatex passes
- **Corrupted references**: Clean build with `rm -f *.aux *.bbl *.blg` then recompile

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check if bibliography exists
ls *.bib

# Verify citation exists in bibliography
grep "citationkey" *.bib

# Run bibtex manually to see errors
bibtex Main_Cleaned_Revised

# Clean build when references are corrupted
rm -f *.aux *.bbl *.blg
./create_pdf.sh Main_Cleaned_Revised.tex
```

## Key Files and Structure
- **Main.tex**: Primary manuscript file using IEEE journal format (ieeecolor.cls)
- **2.References.bib**: Bibliography with robust optimization literature
- **generic.sty**: Custom style definitions
- **Reviews/**: Contains reviewer comments and attachments that need to be addressed
- **LLM.txt**: Research notes on robust optimization concepts and methods

## Reviewer Comments to Address
The paper has received feedback from 4 reviewers with key concerns:
1. Unclear improvements over existing results
2. Language and grammar issues throughout
3. Formatting problems (article usage in captions/titles, formula italics, quotation marks)
4. Suggestion to submit as technical note rather than full article (Reviewer 10)
5. Need for deeper technical content and better presentation

## Figure Files
The repository contains multiple trajectory and visualization figures in EPS/PDF/PNG formats. When updating figures, maintain consistent naming conventions:
- trajectories_*.eps for trajectory plots
- Use descriptive suffixes (e.g., _geometric, _intersection, _nonlinear_exp_no_RC)

## Development Workflow
1. Read reviewer comments in Reviews/ folder before making changes
2. Address formatting issues first (articles, italics, quotation marks)
3. Focus on clarifying technical contributions and improvements over existing work
4. Update figures as needed to better illustrate concepts
5. Check grammar and language throughout the manuscript

## Important Notes
- The paper uses custom theorem environments extensively (theorem, lemma, corollary, etc.)
- Mathematical notation is defined in the preamble with custom commands
- Git status shows several modified trajectory figures - ensure consistency when updating
- Reviews folder is currently untracked - consider adding to git after addressing comments
- Whenever you want to compile a tex file, use @create_pdf.sh

## Critical LaTeX Guidelines (MUST FOLLOW)

### LESSON LEARNED: Multi-line Set Definitions in Align Environment
**CORRECT FORMAT (MUST USE THIS):**
```latex
\begin{align}
\bar{\cal M}:=& \left\{z \in \mathbb P\,\middle|\,\lambda\geq 0, v_i\geq 0, \forall i, \right. \nonumber\\
&{\cal L}(x^\star,\lambda,u,v^\star)-{\cal L}(x^\star,\lambda^\star,u^\star,v^\star)=0, \nonumber\\
&\left. {\cal L}(x^\star,\lambda^\star,u^\star,v^\star)-{\cal L}(x,\lambda^\star,u^\star,v)=0 \right\}\;.\label{sad}
\end{align}
```
**KEY POINTS:**
- Use `\left\{` with `\right.` to balance delimiters across lines
- Use `\middle|` for the vertical bar in set notation
- Use `\left.` with `\right\}` to close the set
- Alignment `&` goes AFTER `:=` on first line, at START of continuation lines
- NEVER use `\Big\{`, `\bigg\{`, or plain `\{...\}` with alignment tabs - causes "Argument of \math@egroup has an extra }" errors

### LESSON LEARNED: LaTeX Math Notation Consistency
- **CRITICAL**: Check document's existing convention - some papers use `{\cal X}` (older style) instead of `\mathcal{X}` (modern style)
- **Subscript notation**: ALWAYS use `i\in[N]` NOT `i_{[N]}`; Use `i\in[N]^+` NOT `i^+_{[N]}`
- These incorrect notations cause compilation errors!

### LESSON LEARNED: Multi-line \rev{} Commands
**WRONG (causes paragraph/math mode errors):**
```latex
\rev{
\begin{enumerate}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{enumerate}
}
```
**CORRECT:**
```latex
\begin{enumerate}
\item \rev{First item}
\item \rev{Second item}
\end{enumerate}
```
- NEVER wrap enumerate/itemize environments inside `\rev{}`
- Apply `\rev{}` to individual items instead

### LESSON LEARNED: Common LaTeX Error Patterns
1. **"Argument of \math@egroup has an extra }"** 
   - Root cause: Trying to use alignment `&` inside set notation `\{...\}`
   - Solution: Use proper `\left\{`, `\middle|`, `\right.` format

2. **"Missing \cr inserted"**
   - Root cause: Incompatible alignment in math environments
   - Solution: Don't mix set notation with align environment tabs

3. **"Paragraph ended before \@textcolor was complete"**
   - Root cause: Multi-line `\rev{}` commands with environments inside
   - Solution: Apply `\rev{}` to content, not structural elements

## Critical LaTeX Guidelines (MUST FOLLOW)
1. **Revnotes (Red Text)**: 
   - Must ONLY describe the immediate blue text that follows
   - Format: "Reviewer X said [issue]. Changes: [specific change to following text]"
   - Do NOT describe changes elsewhere in the document
   
2. **Table Width in Two-Column Format**:
   - Tables must fit within column width (~7.5cm total)
   - Use `\small` and reduce column widths when needed
   - Typical safe widths: `p{2.3cm}` or less per column
   - Remove verbose captions to save space

3. **Abstract Content**:
   - Must match actual paper content - do NOT add examples that don't exist
   - Current valid examples: QP with ellipsoids, nonlinear optimization without RC, distributed sensor placement
   - NO portfolio optimization (this was incorrectly added and removed)

4. **Performance Claims**:
   - Avoid unsubstantiated speedup claims (e.g., "100-200x")
   - Use "significant computational efficiency improvements" instead
   - Only include metrics that can be technically proven

## Current Manuscript Status
- **Main_Cleaned_Revised.tex**: Primary revised manuscript (17 pages)
- **Report.tex**: 3-page revision summary for internal use
- **Response.tex**: 3-page point-by-point reviewer responses
- **Diffs.tex/pdf**: DELETED - key content integrated into revnotes

## Revision Tracking
- Blue text (`\rev{}`) marks all revisions
- Red text (`\revnote{}`) explains reviewer comments being addressed
- ~40% of manuscript has been revised (marked in blue)
- All 42 reviewer comments have been addressed
