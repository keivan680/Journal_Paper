## CRITICAL UNMARKED CHANGES (Require Immediate Attention)

### 1. **ABSTRACT - Lines 134-136** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Section:** Abstract
**Line Numbers:** 134-136
**Severity:** MAJOR CONTENT CHANGE

**Description:** The entire abstract has been completely rewritten but is NOT marked with `\rev{}`.

**Original Abstract (1804 chars):**
```latex
We propose a dynamical system-based approach for solving robust optimization problems in a general convex-concave framework. Our proposed approach offers a novel solution to robust optimization problems by introducing a continuous-time dynamical system, which we call ${\cal RO}$ dynamics...
```

**Revised Abstract (1209 chars):**
```latex
We consider optimization problems with uncertain parameters that belong to known constraint sets. This paper introduces robust optimization (RO) dynamics—a continuous-time dynamical system that directly solves min–max robust optimization problems...
```

**Fix Required:**
```latex
\begin{abstract}
\rev{We consider optimization problems with uncertain parameters that belong to known constraint sets. This paper introduces robust optimization (RO) dynamics—a continuous-time dynamical system that directly solves min–max robust optimization problems without requiring reformulations or explicit uncertainty model specifications. Our key contributions are twofold: (i) we establish the saddle-point property without assuming joint convexity–concavity, and (ii) we construct a novel Lyapunov function that proves global convergence for general robust optimization problems that are convex in the decision variable and concave in the uncertainty. The method operates using only output feedback without requiring explicit cost or constraint function specifications, which permits decentralized implementation. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial speedups over scenario-based methods, including exact solutions for robust quadratic programming with ellipsoidal uncertainties, nonlinear problems where robust counterparts cannot be derived, and distributed sensor placement. The continuous-time formulation permits real-time adaptation and implementation in physical systems.}
\end{abstract}

### 2. **INTRODUCTION - MOTIVATION PARAGRAPH - Line 142** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Section:** Introduction → Motivation and Background subsection
**Line Number:** 142
**Severity:** MAJOR CONTENT CHANGE

**Description:** The opening paragraph of the Introduction section under the new "Motivation and Background" subsection is NOT marked, even though it's completely rewritten from the original.

**Original Opening:**
```
With emerging applications that require solving real-time optimization problems in a reactive manner, this paper describes how interacting dynamical systems can find a robust solution for a broad class of robust optimization problems...
```

**Revised Opening (Line 142 - UNMARKED):**
```
Optimization problems in engineering, finance, and machine learning often involve uncertain parameters that must be handled robustly to ensure reliable performance. Two different approaches can be used: stochastic optimization, where uncertainty is treated as a random variable, or RO, where uncertainty is assumed to be deterministic and bounded...
```

**Fix Required:**
Wrap the entire paragraph on line 142 in `\rev{}`:
```latex
\subsection*{\rev{Motivation and Background}}

\rev{Optimization problems in engineering, finance, and machine learning often involve uncertain parameters that must be handled robustly to ensure reliable performance. Two different approaches can be used: stochastic optimization, where uncertainty is treated as a random variable, or RO, where uncertainty is assumed to be deterministic and bounded. Unlike stochastic optimization, RO does not require any known probability distributions in the problem data. Instead, RO assumes that the uncertain data reside within a predefined uncertainty set, for which constraint violation cannot be tolerated. For more information on robust and stochastic optimization-based approaches, see \cite{bental2009}, \cite{bertsimas2011}, and the references therein. Early works on RO include \cite{soyster1976}, which considered robust linear optimization with ellipsoidal uncertainty sets, and \cite{falk1976}, which presented exact solutions of inexact linear programs as a simple case of RO.}

### 3. **MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS SECTION - Lines 162-175** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Section:** Introduction → Main Contributions subsection
**Line Numbers:** 162-175
**Severity:** MAJOR CONTENT CHANGE

**Description:** The subsection title is marked with `\rev{}`, but the actual content (introductory sentence and all six bullet points) is NOT marked.

**Current Code (PARTIALLY UNMARKED):**
```latex
\subsection*{\rev{Main Contributions}}
The main contributions of this paper are:  <-- UNMARKED
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Model-free operation:} We develop a continuous-time dynamical system... <-- UNMARKED
\item \textbf{Unified framework:} The proposed method handles... <-- UNMARKED
... (4 more unmarked items)
\end{itemize}
```

**Fix Required:**
```latex
\subsection*{\rev{Main Contributions}}
\rev{The main contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Model-free operation:} We develop a continuous-time dynamical system that solves RO problems without requiring explicit knowledge of uncertainty models or problem structure. This enables implementation in physical systems where only measurements are available.

\item \textbf{Unified framework:} The proposed method handles all convex-concave RO problems using a single dynamical system architecture, eliminating problem-specific reformulations.

\item \textbf{Saddle point theory without joint convexity-concavity:} We prove that the saddle point property holds for RO problems despite the Lagrangian lacking joint convexity-concavity (Section \ref{section_saddle}).

\item \textbf{Lyapunov stability analysis:} We construct a Lyapunov function that establishes global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium corresponding to the robust optimal solution.

\item \textbf{Real-time capability:} The continuous-time formulation permits tracking of time-varying uncertainties and decentralized implementation.

\item \textbf{Solutions for problems without tractable robust counterparts:} The method solves problems where reformulation-based approaches fail, including nonlinear constraints with general uncertainty sets.
\end{itemize}}

### 4. **INTRODUCTION - LITERATURE REVIEW PARAGRAPHS - Lines 146-147, 151, 154-155**
**Section:** Introduction → Literature Review subsection
**Line Numbers:** 146-147, 151, 154-155
**Severity:** MODERATE CONTENT CHANGE

**Description:** Several paragraphs in the literature review contain unmarked text that differs from the original.

**Line 146-147:** Standard RC discussion paragraph - appears to have minor wording changes but is NOT marked.

**Line 151:** Typo fix `"constrain"` → `"constraint"` is NOT marked:
```latex
This approach does not require concavity of the constraint in the uncertain variable
```
Should be marked since it's a correction.

**Line 154-155:** Text about oracle-based methods has unmarked changes:
```latex
However, the solution would be approximated with some predetermined accuracy, $\eta$, with the number of iterations growing to $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\eta})$...
```

---

### 5. **PROBLEM FORMULATION - Line 325**
**Section:** Robust Optimization Problems section
**Line Number:** 325
**Severity:** MINOR TEXT CHANGE

**Description:** Changed "the paper" to "this paper" (unmarked)

**Original:**
```latex
We finally introduce the following assumption valid for most of the paper.
```

**Revised (UNMARKED):**
```latex
We finally introduce the following assumption valid for most of this paper.
```

## FORMATTING CHANGES (Lower Priority but Still Need Marking)

### 6. **NOTATIONS SECTION - Line 202**
**Section:** Notations
**Line Number:** 202
**Severity:** FORMATTING/NOTATION CONSISTENCY

**Description:** Index notation changed throughout the paper from subscript to set notation, but the definition line is NOT marked.

**Original:**
```latex
We define $i=0,\cdots,N$ as $i_{[N]}$, and $i=1,\cdots,N$ as $i^+_{[N]}$.
```

**Revised (UNMARKED):**
```latex
We define $i=0,\cdots,N$ as $i\in[N]$, and $i=1,\cdots,N$ as $i\in[N]^+$.
```

**Note:** This changes the notation throughout the entire paper (e.g., `$i_{[N]}$` becomes `$i\in[N]$`, `$i^+_{[N]}$` becomes `$i\in[N]^+$`). This is a technical improvement but should be marked.

---

### 7. **EQUATION FORMATTING - Lines 215, 223, 234, etc.**
**Section:** Problem Formulation
**Line Numbers:** Multiple equation blocks
**Severity:** FORMATTING

**Description:** Equation array alignment changed from `\begin{array}{ccc}` to `\begin{array}{l}` throughout Problem Formulation section.

**Example - Line 215:**
**Original:**
```latex
\begin{array}{ccc}
\mu&:=&\underset{x}{\min}\; f_0(x)\\
&&\text{s.t.}\;\;\;f_i(x,u_i)\leq 0,\;\;\;\; \forall \,u_i\in {\cal U}_i,\;\;\;i^+_{[N]}.
\end{array}
```

**Revised:**
```latex
\begin{array}{l}
\mu:=\min_{x} f_0(x)\\
\text{s.t.}\;\;f_i(x,u_i)\leq 0,\; \forall u_i\in \mathcal{U}_i,\;i\in[N]^+.
\end{array}
```

**Note:** This is a formatting improvement (left-aligned vs. centered), but technically constitutes a change.

### 8. **QUOTATION MARKS - Throughout**
**Section:** Throughout the document
**Line Numbers:** Multiple
**Severity:** FORMATTING

**Description:** Straight double quotes `"` converted to LaTeX-style quotes ``` `` ''' ```.

**Statistics:**
- Original: 21 straight double quotes
- Revised: 4 straight quotes, 69 LaTeX-style quotes

**Example - Line ~307:**
**Original:**
```latex
In this paper, we often call (\ref{G.eq}) as the "lower optimization problems"
```

**Revised:**
```latex
In this paper, we often call (\ref{G.eq}) as the ``lower optimization problems''
```

### 9. **ASSUMPTION FORMATTING - Lines 270-274, 328-329**
**Section:** Assumptions
**Line Numbers:** 270-274 (Assumption 2), 328-329 (Assumption 3)
**Severity:** FORMATTING

**Description:** Assumption enumerate item labels changed without marking.

**Assumption 2 (lines 270-274):**
**Original:**
```latex
\begin{enumerate}
\item [A1] ${\cal RO}$ problem (\ref{RO}) is feasible...
\item [A2] ${\cal RO}$ problem satisfies the Slater...
\end{enumerate}
```

**Revised:**

\item $\mathcal{RO}$ problem satisfies the Slater...
\end{enumerate}
```

**Assumption 3 (line 328):**
**Original:**
```latex
\begin{enumerate}
\item [A3] $c_i > 0$ for $i^+_{[N]}$.
\end{enumerate}
```

**Revised:**
```latex
\begin{assumption} \label{assume_c>0}
$c_i > 0$ for $i\in[N]^+$.
\end{assumption}
```

---

### 10. **ARTICLE USAGE - Throughout**
**Section:** Throughout
**Line Numbers:** Multiple
**Severity:** MINOR CONSISTENCY

**Description:** Hundreds of instances where `${\cal RO}$` was changed to plain `RO` without marking.

**Statistics:**
- Original: 127 instances of `${\cal RO}$`
- Revised: 14 instances of `${\cal RO}$`
- Revised: Many instances of plain `RO` instead

**Note:** This appears to be a deliberate style change to reduce mathematical notation for better readability, but technically unmarked.

1. **Abstract (lines 134-136)** - Wrap entire abstract in `\rev{}`
2. **Introduction opening paragraph (line 142)** - Wrap in `\rev{}`
3. **Main Contributions bullet points (lines 162-175)** - Wrap the intro sentence and all bullet points in `\rev{}`

### Priority 2 (Should Fix):
4. Literature review unmarked text (lines 146-147, 151, 154-155)
5. "this paper" change (line 325)

### Priority 3 (Consider Marking):
6. Notation definition change (line 202)
7. Equation formatting changes (multiple lines)
8. Quotation mark conversions (throughout)
9. Assumption formatting (lines 270-274, 328-329)
10. Article usage consistency (`${\cal RO}$` → `RO`)

## TECHNICAL NOTES

- **Formatting vs. Content:** Items 6-10 are primarily formatting/consistency improvements rather than content changes. However, according to the CLAUDE.md guidelines, ALL changes should ideally be marked for reviewer transparency.

- **Blue Marking Strategy:** The current approach of marking subsection titles with `\rev{}` but leaving content unmarked creates inconsistency. Either mark everything or clearly document what is not marked.

- **Reviewer Expectations:** Reviewers expect to see ALL changes highlighted. Unmarked changes may appear suspicious or be missed during review.
