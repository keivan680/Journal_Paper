# Example C: Robust Dynamic Location Problem

## Overview
This example implements a robust dynamic location problem with multiple autonomous agents and fixed anchors, as described in Section VII.C of the paper "Robust Optimization via Continuous-Time Dynamics". This demonstrates the method's real-time adaptation capabilities and distributed optimization features in dynamic environments.

## Problem Formulation

### Multi-Agent Optimization
Minimize total weighted distances:
```
min Σ_{(i,j)∈E} ½w_{ij}||x_i - x_j||²
```

Subject to robust constraints for each mobile agent:
```
max_{u_i∈U_i} (a_i + P_i·u_i)^T x_i ≤ b_i
```

### Network Structure
- **5 Anchors**: Fixed reference positions (targets/beacons)
- **4 Agents**: Mobile autonomous units
- **Network topology**: Predefined connectivity graph
- **Distributed computation**: Each agent uses only local information

### Uncertainty Model
- Uncertainty set: U_i = {u_i : ||u_i||² ≤ ρ_i²}
- Nominal constraint: x₁ + x₂ ≤ 2.5 (half-space)
- Perturbation: Uncertainty on constraint slope (45° nominal)
- Dynamic changes: ρ² changes from 0.1 to 1.0 during operation

## Three-Phase Simulation Scenario

### Phase 1: Initial Convergence (t = 0-100)
- Agents start at origin (white circles)
- Converge to optimal robust locations
- Uncertainty: ρ² = 0.1 (small)
- Agents 1 & 4 reach constraint boundary
- Agents 2 & 3 find interior positions

### Phase 2: Anchor Rotation (t = 100-250)
- Anchors rotate clockwise at constant speed
- Agents track motion while maintaining:
  - Network connectivity
  - Robust feasibility
  - Optimal formation
- Demonstrates real-time tracking capability

### Phase 3: Uncertainty Change (t = 250-400)
- At t = 300: ρ² increases from 0.1 to 1.0
- Dramatic change in feasible region
- Agents 1, 2, 3 become infeasible momentarily
- Automatic adaptation to new robust feasible set
- SW quadrant becomes the only safe region

## Implementation Details

### Distributed RO Dynamics
For each agent i:
```
ẋᵢ = -Σⱼ w_{ij}(xᵢ - xⱼ) - λᵢ(aᵢ + Pᵢuᵢ)
λ̇ᵢ = [(aᵢ + Pᵢuᵢ)^T xᵢ - bᵢ - vᵢ||uᵢ||²]₊
u̇ᵢ = Pᵢ^T xᵢ - 2vᵢuᵢ
v̇ᵢ = [λᵢ||uᵢ||²]₊
```

### Key Features
1. **Fully Distributed**: Each agent uses only neighborhood information
2. **Asynchronous**: No global clock required
3. **Scalable**: O(n) complexity per agent
4. **Real-time**: Continuous adaptation to changes

## Results

| 3 | [1.10, 0.85] | -0.550 | Interior |
