\section*{Critical Items Requiring Action}

\subsection*{Priority 1 - Not Addressed}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Rev 6, Cmt 5b:} Lemma 1 appears standard - need explicit novelty statement distinguishing from KKT conditions
\item \textbf{Rev 10, Cmt 3b:} Lemma 1 appears to be standard saddle point - need clear differentiation from Sion/Rockafellar theorems
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Priority 2 - Partially Addressed}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Rev 5, Cmt 3:} Convergence performance analysis - need quantitative convergence rates
\item \textbf{Rev 10, Cmt 3c:} How Lemma 1 differs from classical - more explicit comparison needed
\item \textbf{Rev 10, Cmt 4d:} No empirical parameter selection strategies for $c_i$
\item \textbf{Rev 10, Cmt 9:} Theorem 4 proof conclusion - may need to cite Haddad Theorem 4.19 or provide complete self-contained proof
\item \textbf{Rev 10, Cmt 11a:} Examples could include more realistic scenario-based RO settings
\end{enumerate}
